# Snazzy Paws Grooming - BIT607 Web Development Project

This is a mock-up website developed for the BIT607 course.

## Note about .htaccess and .htpasswd

Due to GitHub Pages limitations, features such as `.htaccess` and `.htpasswd` for directory protection **do not work** when hosted directly on GitHub. These features require a proper Apache web server to function.

If testing locally with Apache2, the protected area (e.g., `staff.html`) should be placed inside `/var/www/html/`, and Apache must be properly configured to support `.htaccess`.
